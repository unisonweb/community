# Unison: Community Hub

This is the official Unison community hub. Welcome!

* There's a forum for [Unison Q&A, discussion, announcements, job postings, etc](https://github.com/unisonweb/community/discussions/1).
* Also check out [Unison Slack](https://unison-lang.org/slack) for chat and real-time support.
* Official Unison events will go on [the Unison calendar](https://unison-lang.org/calendar).
* Feel free to open a PR if you'd like to add some other community resource ("List of Unison meetup groups" or "Interesting blog posts related to Unison" or "Companies using Unison"). If you're not sure if it belongs here, feel free to get in touch via Slack or post a question in [the forum](https://github.com/unisonweb/community/discussions).
